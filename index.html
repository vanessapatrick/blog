        <span>Welcome to my blog</span>
        <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where thoughts become words and stories come to life. My name is Gbamila Darasimi, a writer with a love for storytelling in all its forms. Whether it's through short stories or poems, my goal is to capture the beauty of the everyday and the complexity of human emotions.

          <p>How would I tell the world I lost you? 
            How do I tell myself to move on? 
            How would I live without you, Eniola? Come back to me, please come back to me.
            You went out with your friends the night before, but we spoke all night. You wanted to spend time with me because the time we spent apart has been getting to us. Me especially. Our conversation that night keeps playing in my head. I can’t get it out.

        <p>This was your last day in Abuja, and you were at the club with your friends. I got dragged to the club that day to celebrate a friend’s birthday. I hated the club, So I sat down by the edge of the bar while my friends danced till their feet were numb. I see you by the restroom door from where i was, but it was just a glimpse and I looked away. I left the club wondering who you were because I Knew you were not from around here. You had been on my mind from day to day, but I was too scared to ask anyone at the club about you.<a href="./stories/anjola.html" class="read-more">Read More</a></p>

              The time you came <br>
              Everything stopped <br>
              And it was just the two of us <br>
