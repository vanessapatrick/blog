            <p>They say people come and go. <br>
              You came at the most random time <br>
              But you still found a way to make it yours<br>
              The time you came <br>
              Everything stopped <br>
              And it was just the two of us <br>
              I may never find the words beautiful enough <br>
              To describe the time in my life you altered <br>

            <p>Brown eyes<br>
              Almond shaped <br>
              You had your lashes done <br>
              Dark brown Skin <br>
              Your skin was smooth like milk <br>
              You had your hair done in goddess braids that made you look like you were made for that role <br>
